# Python Dungeon - A simple command line game

## What is Python Dungeon?
Python Dungeon is a very simple self-contained command-line game. It follows a turn-based system where you can make moves while fighting against waves of bugs.
After every wave, you get opportunites to upgrade stats such as your attack power to better deal with those pesky critters!

## Playing the game
It's simply a self-contained Python script which doesn't require any libraries beyond those built-in. Just run it and you're good to go.

## Current Features
- Player abilities: Attack, Heal
- Enemies: Beetle, Spider, Wasp, Mosquito
- Poison
- Critical hits
- Dodges
- Godmode for fun

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, although I'm not entirely sure how they work just yet as this is my first foray into the world of Git.

## Background
This game was originally made to be a part of my creativity portfolio at school. It became a bit of a hit among some of my peers, some of whom requested that it
be made open-source. So, it was a perfect opportunity to make a GitHub account and a repo.
